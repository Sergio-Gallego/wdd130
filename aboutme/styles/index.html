    <p>Hello everyone, I am from Spain and I live in the South of Spain in Alcalá de Guadaíra. It is a small city close to Sevilla. I love my to hang out wiht my friends and work out to be fit.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latte-day Saints for 7 years and my current calling is as Ward Clerk. I like to help the missionaries to preach the gospel in my city.</p>
    <P>I am working as office clerk and I have studies in administration but I want to have more knowledge about tecnologie because I think is very important to know how this tecnologie works and also because I need to improve my studies to get a better job.</P>
    <P>I enjoyed it a lot last year BYU Pathway I think this program will change the world in countries that to get a higher education is expensive and that people will be able to support their families, communities and the church as well. Thank you so much to look at my web page. </P>
